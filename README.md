# Healthcare Microservices Platform

A modern, scalable healthcare platform built with microservices architecture, designed to efficiently handle patient management, billing operations, and real-time analytics.

## Overview

This platform provides a robust solution for healthcare organizations by implementing a microservices-based architecture that ensures high availability, scalability, and maintainability. The system is built using modern Java technologies and follows best practices in distributed systems design.

## Architecture

The platform consists of three main microservices:

### 1. Patient Service (Port: 4000)
- **Core Functionality**: Manages all patient-related operations
- **Features**:
  - Complete CRUD operations for patient data
  - Real-time patient information validation
  - Integration with Billing Service via gRPC
  - Event publishing to Kafka for analytics
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for patient management

### 2. Billing Service (Ports: 4001, 9001)
- **Core Functionality**: Handles all billing-related operations
- **Features**:
  - Billing account management
  - gRPC interface for inter-service communication
  - Automated billing account creation
  - Secure payment processing

### 3. Analytics Service (Port: 4002)
- **Core Functionality**: Provides data insights and analysis
- **Features**:
  - Real-time event processing via Kafka
  - Patient data analytics
  - Asynchronous processing architecture
  - Reporting capabilities

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Java**: Version 22
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: Spring Data JPA
- **API Specifications**: Jakarta EE

### Communication
- **Service-to-Service**: gRPC
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka
- **API Style**: REST (Patient Service)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 22 JDK
- Maven
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kafka

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
bash
cd healthcare-microservices
```
3. Build all services:
```
bash
mvn clean install
```
### Running the Services

Each service can be run independently:
```
bash
# Patient Service
java -jar patient-service/target/patient-service.jar

# Billing Service
java -jar billing-service/target/billing-service.jar

# Analytics Service
java -jar analytics-service/target/analytics-service.jar
```
Alternatively, use Docker Compose:
```
bash
docker-compose up
```
## Service Ports

- Patient Service: `4000`
- Billing Service: `4001` (HTTP), `9001` (gRPC)
- Analytics Service: `4002`
